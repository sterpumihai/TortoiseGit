<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<simpara>The Git pack format is how Git stores most of its primary repository
data. Over the lifetime of a repository, loose objects (if any) and
smaller packs are consolidated into larger pack(s). See
<xref linkend="git-gc(1)" /> and <xref linkend="git-pack-objects(1)" />.</simpara>
<simpara>The pack format is also used over-the-wire, see
e.g. <xref linkend="gitprotocol-v2(5)" />, as well as being a part of
other container formats in the case of <xref linkend="gitformat-bundle(5)" />.</simpara>
</simplesect>
<simplesect id="gitformat-pack(5)__checksums_and_object_ids">
<title>Checksums and object IDs</title>
<simpara>In a repository using the traditional SHA-1, pack checksums, index checksums,
and object IDs (object names) mentioned below are all computed using SHA-1.
Similarly, in SHA-256 repositories, these values are computed using SHA-256.</simpara>

<section id="gitformat-pack(5)__size_encoding">
<title>Size encoding</title>
<simpara>This document uses the following "size encoding" of non-negative
integers: From each byte, the seven least significant bits are
used to form the resulting integer. As long as the most significant
bit is 1, this process continues; the byte with MSB 0 provides the
last seven bits.  The seven-bit chunks are concatenated. Later
values are more significant.</simpara>
<simpara>This size encoding should not be confused with the "offset encoding",
which is also used in this document.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="gitformat-pack(5)__deltified_representation">
<title>Deltified representation</title>
<simpara>Conceptually there are only four object types: commit, tree, tag and
blob. However to save space, an object could be stored as a "delta" of
another "base" object. These representations are assigned new types
ofs-delta and ref-delta, which is only valid in a pack file.</simpara>
<simpara>Both ofs-delta and ref-delta store the "delta" to be applied to
another object (called <emphasis>base object</emphasis>) to reconstruct the object. The
difference between them is, ref-delta directly encodes base object
name. If the base object is in the same pack, ofs-delta encodes
the offset of the base object in the pack instead.</simpara>
<simpara>The base object could also be deltified if it's in the same pack.
Ref-delta can also refer to an object outside the pack (i.e. the
so-called "thin pack"). When stored on disk however, the pack should
be self contained to avoid cyclic dependency.</simpara>
<simpara>The delta data starts with the size of the base object and the
size of the object to be reconstructed. These sizes are
encoded using the size encoding from above.  The remainder of
the delta data is a sequence of instructions to reconstruct the object
from the base object. If the base object is deltified, it must be
converted to canonical form first. Each instruction appends more and
more data to the target object until it's complete. There are two
supported instructions so far: one for copying a byte range from the
source object and one for inserting new data embedded in the
instruction itself.</simpara>
<simpara>Each instruction has variable length. Instruction type is determined
by the seventh bit of the first octet. The following diagrams follow
the convention in RFC 1951 (Deflate compressed data format).</simpara>

<title>Instruction to copy from base object</title>
<literallayout class="monospaced">+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------+-------+-------+
| 1xxxxxxx | offset1 | offset2 | offset3 | offset4 | size1 | size2 | size3 |
+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------+-------+-------+</literallayout>
<simpara>This is the instruction format to copy a byte range from the source
object. It encodes the offset to copy from and the number of bytes to
copy. Offset and size are in little-endian order.</simpara>
<simpara>All offset and size bytes are optional. This is to reduce the
instruction size when encoding small offsets or sizes. The first seven
bits in the first octet determine which of the next seven octets is
present. If bit zero is set, offset1 is present. If bit one is set
offset2 is present and so on.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that a more compact instruction does not change offset and size
encoding. For example, if only offset2 is omitted like below, offset3
still contains bits 16-23. It does not become offset2 and contains
bits 8-15 even if it's right next to offset1.</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">+----------+---------+---------+

<simpara>In its most compact form, this instruction only takes up one byte
(0x80) with both offset and size omitted, which will have default
values zero. There is another exception: size zero is automatically
converted to 0x10000.</simpara>

    Each table entry corresponds to a single pack (in the order that
    they appear above in the `PNAM` chunk). The values for each table
    entry are as follows:
    - The first bit position (in pseudo-pack order, see below) to

    - The number of bits whose objects are selected from that pack.</literallayout>
<literallayout class="monospaced">OID Fanout (ID: {'O', 'I', 'D', 'F'})
    The ith entry, F[i], stores the number of OIDs with first

    number of objects.</literallayout>

    2: The offset within the pack.
        If all offsets are less than 2^32, then the large offset chunk
        will not exist and offsets are stored as in IDX v1.
        If there is at least one offset value larger than 2^32-1, then
        the large offset chunk must exist, and offsets larger than
        2^31-1 must be stored in it instead. If the large offset chunk
        exists and the 31st bit is on, then removing that bit reveals
        the row in the large offsets containing the 8-byte offset of
        this object.</literallayout>

<simplesect id="gitformat-pack(5)__multi_pack_index_reverse_indexes">
<title>multi-pack-index reverse indexes</title>
<simpara>Similar to the pack-based reverse index, the multi-pack index can also
be used to generate a reverse index.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead of mapping between offset, pack-, and index position, this
reverse index maps between an object's position within the MIDX, and
that object's position within a pseudo-pack that the MIDX describes
(i.e., the ith entry of the multi-pack reverse index holds the MIDX
position of ith object in pseudo-pack order).</simpara>
<simpara>To clarify the difference between these orderings, consider a multi-pack
reachability bitmap (which does not yet exist, but is what we are
building towards here). Each bit needs to correspond to an object in the
MIDX, and so we need an efficient mapping from bit position to MIDX
position.</simpara>
<simpara>One solution is to let bits occupy the same position in the oid-sorted
index stored by the MIDX. But because oids are effectively random, their
resulting reachability bitmaps would have no locality, and thus compress
poorly. (This is the reason that single-pack bitmaps use the pack
ordering, and not the .idx ordering, for the same purpose.)</simpara>
<simpara>So we'd like to define an ordering for the whole MIDX based around
pack ordering, which has far better locality (and thus compresses more
efficiently). We can think of a pseudo-pack created by the concatenation
of all of the packs in the MIDX. E.g., if we had a MIDX with three packs
(a, b, c), with 10, 15, and 20 objects respectively, we can imagine an
ordering of the objects like:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">|a,0|a,1|...|a,9|b,0|b,1|...|b,14|c,0|c,1|...|c,19|</literallayout>
<simpara>where the ordering of the packs is defined by the MIDX's pack list,
and then the ordering of objects within each pack is the same as the
order in the actual packfile.</simpara>
<simpara>Given the list of packs and their counts of objects, you can
naïvely reconstruct that pseudo-pack ordering (e.g., the object at
position 27 must be (c,1) because packs "a" and "b" consumed 25 of the
slots). But there's a catch. Objects may be duplicated between packs, in
which case the MIDX only stores one pointer to the object (and thus we'd
want only one slot in the bitmap).</simpara>
<simpara>Callers could handle duplicates themselves by reading objects in order
of their bit-position, but that's linear in the number of objects, and
much too expensive for ordinary bitmap lookups. Building a reverse index
solves this, since it is the logical inverse of the index, and that
index has already removed duplicates. But, building a reverse index on
the fly can be expensive. Since we already have an on-disk format for
pack-based reverse indexes, let's reuse it for the MIDX's pseudo-pack,
too.</simpara>
<simpara>Objects from the MIDX are ordered as follows to string together the
pseudo-pack. Let <emphasis>pack(o)</emphasis> return the pack from which <emphasis>o</emphasis> was selected
by the MIDX, and define an ordering of packs based on their numeric ID
(as stored by the MIDX). Let <emphasis>offset(o)</emphasis> return the object offset of <emphasis>o</emphasis>
within <emphasis>pack(o)</emphasis>. Then, compare <emphasis>o1</emphasis> and <emphasis>o2</emphasis> as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
If one of <emphasis>pack(o1)</emphasis> and <emphasis>pack(o2)</emphasis> is preferred and the other
    is not, then the preferred one sorts first.
</simpara>
<simpara>(This is a detail that allows the MIDX bitmap to determine which
pack should be used by the pack-reuse mechanism, since it can ask
the MIDX for the pack containing the object at bit position 0).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
If <emphasis>pack(o1) ≠ pack(o2)</emphasis>, then sort the two objects in descending
    order based on the pack ID.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Otherwise, <emphasis>pack(o1) = pack(o2)</emphasis>, and the objects are sorted in
    pack-order (i.e., <emphasis>o1</emphasis> sorts ahead of <emphasis>o2</emphasis> exactly when <emphasis>offset(o1)
    &lt; offset(o2)</emphasis>).
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In short, a MIDX's pseudo-pack is the de-duplicated concatenation of
objects in packs stored by the MIDX, laid out in pack order, and the
packs arranged in MIDX order (with the preferred pack coming first).</simpara>
<simpara>The MIDX's reverse index is stored in the optional <emphasis>RIDX</emphasis> chunk within
the MIDX itself.</simpara>
<section id="gitformat-pack(5)__emphasis_btmp_emphasis_chunk">
<title><emphasis>BTMP</emphasis> chunk</title>
<simpara>The Bitmapped Packfiles (<emphasis>BTMP</emphasis>) chunk encodes additional information
about the objects in the multi-pack index's reachability bitmap. Recall
that objects from the MIDX are arranged in "pseudo-pack" order (see
above) for reachability bitmaps.</simpara>
<simpara>From the example above, suppose we have packs "a", "b", and "c", with
10, 15, and 20 objects, respectively. In pseudo-pack order, those would
be arranged as follows:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">|a,0|a,1|...|a,9|b,0|b,1|...|b,14|c,0|c,1|...|c,19|</literallayout>
<simpara>When working with single-pack bitmaps (or, equivalently, multi-pack
reachability bitmaps with a preferred pack), <xref linkend="git-pack-objects(1)" />
performs verbatim reuse, attempting to reuse chunks of the bitmapped
or preferred packfile instead of adding objects to the packing list.</simpara>
<simpara>When a chunk of bytes is reused from an existing pack, any objects
contained therein do not need to be added to the packing list, saving
memory and CPU time. But a chunk from an existing packfile can only be
reused when the following conditions are met:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The chunk contains only objects which were requested by the caller
    (i.e. does not contain any objects which the caller didn't ask for
    explicitly or implicitly).
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
All objects stored in non-thin packs as offset- or reference-deltas
    also include their base object in the resulting pack.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The <emphasis>BTMP</emphasis> chunk encodes the necessary information in order to implement
multi-pack reuse over a set of packfiles as described above.
Specifically, the <emphasis>BTMP</emphasis> chunk encodes three pieces of information (all
32-bit unsigned integers in network byte-order) for each packfile <emphasis>p</emphasis>
that is stored in the MIDX, as follows:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<emphasis>bitmap_pos</emphasis>
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The first bit position (in pseudo-pack order) in the
  multi-pack index's reachability bitmap occupied by an object from <emphasis>p</emphasis>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<emphasis>bitmap_nr</emphasis>
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The number of bit positions (including the one at
  <emphasis>bitmap_pos</emphasis>) that encode objects from that pack <emphasis>p</emphasis>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>For example, the <emphasis>BTMP</emphasis> chunk corresponding to the above example (with
packs a, b, and c) would look like:</simpara>

<title>cruft packs</title>
<simpara>The cruft packs feature offer an alternative to Git's traditional mechanism of
removing unreachable objects. This document provides an overview of Git's
pruning mechanism, and how a cruft pack can be used instead to accomplish the
same.</simpara>
<section id="gitformat-pack(5)__background">
<title>Background</title>
<simpara>To remove unreachable objects from your repository, Git offers <emphasis>git repack -Ad</emphasis>
(see <xref linkend="git-repack(1)" />). Quoting from the documentation:</simpara>
<screen>[...] unreachable objects in a previous pack become loose, unpacked objects,
instead of being left in the old pack. [...] loose unreachable objects will be
pruned according to normal expiry rules with the next 'git gc' invocation.</screen>
<simpara>Unreachable objects aren't removed immediately, since doing so could race with
an incoming push which may reference an object which is about to be deleted.
Instead, those unreachable objects are stored as loose objects and stay that way
until they are older than the expiration window, at which point they are removed
by <xref linkend="git-prune(1)" />.</simpara>
<simpara>Git must store these unreachable objects loose in order to keep track of their
per-object mtimes. If these unreachable objects were written into one big pack,
then either freshening that pack (because an object contained within it was
re-written) or creating a new pack of unreachable objects would cause the pack's
mtime to get updated, and the objects within it would never leave the expiration
window. Instead, objects are stored loose in order to keep track of the
individual object mtimes and avoid a situation where all cruft objects are
freshened at once.</simpara>
<simpara>This can lead to undesirable situations when a repository contains many
unreachable objects which have not yet left the grace period. Having large
directories in the shards of <emphasis>.git/objects</emphasis> can lead to decreased performance in
the repository. But given enough unreachable objects, this can lead to inode
starvation and degrade the performance of the whole system. Since we
can never pack those objects, these repositories often take up a large amount of
disk space, since we can only zlib compress them, but not store them in delta
chains.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="gitformat-pack(5)__cruft_packs_2">
<title>Cruft packs</title>
<simpara>A cruft pack eliminates the need for storing unreachable objects in a loose
state by including the per-object mtimes in a separate file alongside a single
pack containing all loose objects.</simpara>
<simpara>A cruft pack is written by <emphasis>git repack --cruft</emphasis> when generating a new pack.
<xref linkend="git-pack-objects(1)" />'s <emphasis>--cruft</emphasis> option. Note that <emphasis>git repack --cruft</emphasis>
is a classic all-into-one repack, meaning that everything in the resulting pack is
reachable, and everything else is unreachable. Once written, the <emphasis>--cruft</emphasis>
option instructs <emphasis>git repack</emphasis> to generate another pack containing only objects
not packed in the previous step (which equates to packing all unreachable
objects together). This progresses as follows:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Enumerate every object, marking any object which is (a) not contained in a
     kept-pack, and (b) whose mtime is within the grace period as a traversal
     tip.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Perform a reachability traversal based on the tips gathered in the previous
     step, adding every object along the way to the pack.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Write the pack out, along with a <emphasis>.mtimes</emphasis> file that records the per-object
     timestamps.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>This mode is invoked internally by <xref linkend="git-repack(1)" /> when instructed to
write a cruft pack. Crucially, the set of in-core kept packs is exactly the set
of packs which will not be deleted by the repack; in other words, they contain
all of the repository's reachable objects.</simpara>
<simpara>When a repository already has a cruft pack, <emphasis>git repack --cruft</emphasis> typically only
adds objects to it. An exception to this is when <emphasis>git repack</emphasis> is given the
<emphasis>--cruft-expiration</emphasis> option, which allows the generated cruft pack to omit
expired objects instead of waiting for <xref linkend="git-gc(1)" /> to expire those objects
later on.</simpara>
<simpara>It is <xref linkend="git-gc(1)" /> that is typically responsible for removing expired
unreachable objects.</simpara>

<simpara>
The location of the per-object mtime data.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>On the location of mtime data, a new auxiliary file tied to the pack was chosen
to avoid complicating the <emphasis>.idx</emphasis> format. If the <emphasis>.idx</emphasis> format were ever to gain
support for optional chunks of data, it may make sense to consolidate the
<emphasis>.mtimes</emphasis> format into the <emphasis>.idx</emphasis> itself.</simpara>
